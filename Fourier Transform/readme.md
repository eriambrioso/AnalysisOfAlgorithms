# The Fast Fourier Transform

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform)

Lots of information can be found in Chapter 30 of *Introduction to Algorithms* (Corman et al., 2009)
 
The Fast Fourier Transform(FFT) is used in digital video and audio processing. In this repository there are 2 python programs the first implements iterative FFT and the second implements recursive FFT.
